- `levelup.html` - Hub for advanced learning and upskilling.
- `events.js`, `events.json` - Dynamic event and hackathon data loading system.
- `style.css` - Global stylesheet including the UI theme, smooth scrolling, and dynamic layouts.
- `script.js` - Main JavaScript for landing page animations and navigation behavior.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Since this is a straightforward frontend project, getting started is very simple:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FirdaushAnwer/code-collab-website.git
   ```

2. **Open the project:**
   You can simply open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.
   
   *Note: Because the project fetches data dynamically from JSON files (like `certifications.json` and `events.json`), you may encounter CORS issues if you just double-click the HTML file. It's recommended to serve the folder via a local web server.*
   
   **Using Node.js/npm:**
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```
   
   **Using Python:**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
